question is what is your opinion about
00:02
machine intelligence and its application
00:05
and potential I would like to ask for in
00:08
such a way that my opinion I will limit
00:12
to one problem which is very interesting
00:14
for me I think that one most challenging
00:18
problem in computer intelligence or is a
00:22
problem about evolutionary emergence of
00:26
complicated problem or complicated
00:29
algorithm icings that is a very big
00:32
change for computer intelligence or
00:34
computational intelligence of also or
00:37
emotional algorithm or neural network
00:40
ATC it is a very complicated problem and
00:43
Isis high-value I I am pretty sure that
00:46
in the course 10 or 15 years is will be
00:50
most interesting problem in the computer
00:53
intelligence about evolution about
00:56
evolutionary emergence of very
00:58
complicated algorithmic some
01:02
evolutionary emergence without input of
01:06
a human factor and so on what are the
01:10
most important aspects of these
01:12
technologies for real-world applications
01:15
I think that is completely new paradigm
01:19
in computer science and I think that
01:24
some impact for a human society of this
01:28
new technology will be that this is
01:30
approaches to construct a new more
01:34
effective algorithm for computer which
01:37
will be user friendly with emotional for
01:43
example communicating in natural
01:45
language and so on I think do you think
01:48
the world should discuss the problem of
01:51
interaction human-robot interaction if
01:55
the world should discuss about it button
01:58
if I weather will be possible some
02:01
discussion between robot and and
02:03
human yeah yes I sing sister it is of
02:06
almost if it yes a SiFi story was really
02:10
possible but you know I think that also
02:13
in the present time there exists some a
02:16
computer system which communicates
02:19
partially with a human user and if you
02:23
are not a professional in this field it
02:26
is very difficult for you to solve
02:28
problem whether you are communicated
02:29
with program or with video with human
02:35
societies I think that is it it is I
02:39
believe that in the course of 10 or 15
02:42
or 20 years will emerge also
02:44
evolutionary it is not a problem for
02:48
classical artificial intelligence while
02:50
at various degrees also some some
02:53
evolutionary emergency problems that it
02:55
will be possible to communicate for
02:58
example by natural language with robot
03:02
do you believe that the artificial brain
03:05
will be created it is not this I think
03:11
some main dream all oh man who are
03:15
working artificial intelligence weather
03:17
is really possible that of course I I
03:20
believe that that yes that it will
03:24
recreate it what is the main problem
03:27
user is hardware oh no what kind of
03:31
which what kind of hardware the mind
03:37
will be implemented and the second
03:39
problem how to construct if if we have
03:42
hard hardware then another problem how
03:45
to construct the disease is super
03:48
program i may say and i see is it also
03:53
their assumptions some evolutionary
03:55
emergence all these complicated problem
03:59
programmer be some module structures
04:02
that will be independently developed
04:04
some model for vision for recognition of
04:09
sin ver on
