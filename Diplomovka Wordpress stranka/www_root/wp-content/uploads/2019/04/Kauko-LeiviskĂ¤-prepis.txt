so many research questions open but I
feel that this is this is very important
for industry of people when they put
money to application table to get it
would like to get it back and and one
one more thing that we are found very
important in in Unitas safety so we have
a task force for safety critical factors
of intelligent systems it's it's also
very interesting and very very important
in practice do you believe then the
brain will be created if you yes no
that's very popular question yes it's
very difficult to answer yes and or no
to this question because it depends on
what you mean by brain I guess that to
some extent answer is yes but if you
look at human brain my answer is no
